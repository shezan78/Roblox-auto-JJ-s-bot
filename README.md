# IMPORTANT -
```lua
  To start the bot is very important, for all of them, after you press start, you will have to go to roblox and press space and then enter and it automatically starts, but you have to keep repeating those 2 keys. For Cheer jacks, you just have to press enter for it to work.
```

# Features -
```python
  -- Begin at: What number you put is which ever number you start at, for example if you stop because of something, put the last number you've said
  -- End at: Self explanatory, it tells you which number you will stop at (Customizable)
  -- Capitilization: Has 3 different modes, One , one , and ONE .
  -- Jack type: Shows which type of jack you want to do, the regular is GJ'S and JJ'S, but you can also do CJ'S DJ'S and HJ'S
  -- Punctuation: Which letter or symbol you END IN, for example One turns into One. Or one/ or One!
  -- Start/Stop buttons: Self explanatory, if you already have done the amount of jacks inputted in End at: it will automatically be stopped, start just starts the bot.
